# EXPLORING DATA TYPES AND VARIABLES
## BUILD - IN DATA TYPES
- Numbers

## VARIABLE DECLARATION

```dart
int age = 37;
//  OR
var age = 37; // It is inferred as integer automatically.
```
2. Define a value "Subham" [Let's say it is your name]
```dart
String name = "Subham";
//  OR
var name = "Subham"; // It is inferred as String automatically.
```

```dart
bool isAlive = true;

var isAlive = true; // It is inferred as boolean automatically.
