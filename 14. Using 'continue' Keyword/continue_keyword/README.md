# USING `continue` KEYWORD
The continue statement skips the subsequent statements in the current iteration and takes the control back to the beginning of the loop. Unlike the break statement, the continue statement doesnâ€™t exit the loop. It terminates the current iteration and starts the subsequent iteration.
## SYNTAX
```dart
continue;
```
