# EXPRESSIONS IN FUNCTION
Using short hand syntax to define expressions in Functions.
<br/>
In dart, we have fat arrow notation ( => ). A fat arrow is used to define a single expression in a function. This is a cleaner way to write functions with a single statement.
- Return Type consists of datatype like void, int, bool, etc.
- Function Name defines the name of the function.
- Parameters are the list of parameters funvtion requires.
#### When the body of the function contains only one line, you can omit the curly braces and the return statement in favor of the "arrow syntax".
- Fat arrow is a clean way to write function expression in a single line.
- Fat arrow notation doesn't have statements body'{ }'
- The statement body is replaced with ' => ' fat arrow which points to a single statement.
